When calling gator_annotate_channel_color_ts()

if it's in interrupt context, 
it will go to void tsai_annotate_enter_lock(int cpu_id, unsigned int seq_no), which write the annotation in a deferred buffer

When exiting 
it will call void tsai_annotate_exit_lock(int cpu_id, unsigned int seq_no), which scheduler a deferred work


if in interrupt
static void kannotate_write(const char *ptr, unsigned int size) 
will write to deferred buffer
